### Work Done under Eklavya Internship IIT Bombay, 2018
A custom module for a Content Management System - Drupal 8.
HTML5  or H5P allows the creation of interactive educational content on various Content Management Systems like Moodle, Drupal, and Sunbird. H5P supports xAPI that emits user-interaction data with H5P content. The amount of data that xAPI generates can provide meaningful insight to the creator about usersâ€™ interactions with the content, which can help them tailor their content for better learning. The module VizH5P aims to obtain this interaction information, store it and present it in a manner that is easy to interpret.
